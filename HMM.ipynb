    "In HMMs, we observe some outcome variables (<b>$O_1,O_2...,O_T$</b>) which are driven from latent (hidden) variables. The probability of getting that outcome from one of the hidden state is called emission probability (and is denoted by <b>B</b>). In each time step, the latent state may change. However, this change depends only on the previous hidden state (hence it is called Markov model). These states transition with probability given by <b>A</b>. The model starts from an initial state. The initial state is denoted by <b>$\\pi$</b>. \n",
